#In this folder, we dicusss about the concept of creation of Knowldege graph from the relational database. 

In this step, we map from multiples sources using the developed ontology. Then we generated an RDF file and stores it as a knowledge graph.

For data mapping, we have used the SDM RDFIzer, which creates a mapping rule for the conversion of tabular data into triples, and the detailed instructions are given below.

## Instructions to run SDM RDIFzer

- clone the SDM-Fizer https://github.com/SDM-TIB/SDM-RDFizer
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Move to the example folder
- Open config.ini
- Change the main_directory- /data where your config and mapping file is present
- Number\_of_datasets- 1 (number of mapping file(not number of dataset)
- output\_folder:\${default:main_directory}/output
- It will consider the main director and make an output file}
- - Now move the dataset1}
- - If you want to change the name of the output file. name: joinCondition}
- - It will provider the directory for mapping file mapping: \${default:main\_directory}/mapping.ttl}
- - output_folder}: \${default:main\_directory}/output
- - item It will consider the main director and make an output file
- Open mapping.ttl
- Change the source name for csv file   rml:source \data
- Run the rdifzer using python rdfizer/run\_rdfizer.py C:\Gautam\TIB\SDM-RDFizer-master\example\config.ini
- Result- the obtained result will be store in t
